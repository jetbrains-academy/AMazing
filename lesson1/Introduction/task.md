In this project we'll create a maze using algorithm that treats a completed maze as a tree, the branches of the tree representing paths through the maze. This algorithm is called Depth First Search (DFS).

In two dimensions, a maze is a series of paths separated by walls, and to simplify the generation one can think of the maze as a 2-dimensional grid.
